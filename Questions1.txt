Q.
What is RAID 0?
A.
Striping (This RAID type enables data to be distributed across multiple drives. 
This provides a significant performance increase. However, since the data is distributed 
across multiple drives, the failure of a single drive means that all data is lost.)

Q.
What is RAID 1?
A.
Mirroring (This RAID type stores duplicate data on one or more other drives. 
This provides redundancy so that the failure of a drive does not cause the loss of data. 
The Mirror can be recreated by replacing the drive and restoring the data from the good drive.

Q.
What is a UPS used for?
A.
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) Helps protect against potential electrical power problems 
by supplying a consistent level of electrical power to a computer or other device. 
The UPS provides a consistent quality of power when brownouts and blackouts occur.

can affect the quality of communications, transmissions, and playback.

Q.
What are the 4 basic units of electricity and their units of measurement?
A.
- Voltage, Volts (V)
- Resistance, Ohms (â„¦)
- Current, Amperes or Amps (A)
- Power, Watts (W)
