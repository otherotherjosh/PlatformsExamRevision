Revision for your final exam with Platform Paul

Hi!  :D

If you are contributing answers to the Questions txt files just follow the formatting from whats currently there.

all the questions are in (but it functions the same as answers if you must know)

"A." tells the program this is the answer
the next line down is the start of the answer
every line until the next "Q." or the end of the file is part of the answer

it gets .Trim()-ed so making cool poetry where words are randomly in the middle
of the page may not work the way you intended


Some unicode symbols (special quote marks and apostrophes and stuff) that the console doesn't agree with could still be present
because I copied the questions from the Word/PDF files


i ran out of things to say

## New Features and Updates (Version 1.1)

We have added a new functionality to the question answering process. Now, during any question, you can go back to the main menu by inputting "m". This new feature provides more flexibility during your revision process. 

Here is how the new feature works:

1. After a question or an answer is displayed, you will see a prompt saying "Press ENTER to reveal answer, M for Main Menu" or "Press ENTER to go to next, M for Main Menu".
2. If you press the "m" key, you will be taken back to the main menu, allowing you to choose another action.
3. If you press the Enter key, you will proceed as usual.

This update is aimed at providing a better, more flexible revision experience. Happy studying!
