Revision for your final exam with Platform Paul

Hi!  :D

If you are contributing answers to the Questions txt files just follow the formatting from whats currently there.

all the questions are in (but it functions the same as answers if you must know)

"A." tells the program this is the answer
the next line down is the start of the answer
every line until the next "Q." or the end of the file is part of the answer

it gets .Trim()-ed so making cool poetry where words are randomly in the middle
of the page may not work the way you intended


Some unicode symbols (special quote marks and apostrophes and stuff) that the console doesn't agree with could still be present
because I copied the questions from the Word/PDF files


i ran out of things to say
